Your phone is now recording golf swings via HTTP API.

## Common Use Cases

### Golf Simulator Integration
Add this to your simulator's webhook/HTTP trigger settings:
```
http://YOUR_PHONE_IP:8080/api/record
```

### Remote Control from Computer
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://192.168.1.100:8080/

# Start recording
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/record

# View recordings list
curl http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/recordings
```

### Shell Script Trigger
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# record-swing.sh
PHONE_IP="192.168.1.100"
curl -X POST http://$PHONE_IP:8080/api/record
echo "Recording started on phone!"
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Server won't start"**
- Check notification permission is granted
- Restart the app

**"Can't connect from other device"**
- Verify both on same WiFi network
- Check phone's IP address in app
- Try pinging the phone: `ping 192.168.1.100`

**"Recording failed"**
- Ensure storage space available
- Check camera permission granted
- Try manual recording button first

**"Need to change duration"**
- Currently must edit `Config.kt` default value
- Or manually create config.json in app storage
- Future: Will add settings UI
